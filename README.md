## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Problem Statement  4: Craft the Future of Onchain Consumer Experiences with Base

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Conneqt solves the issue of fragmented collaboration in scientific research by providing a decentralized platform where *researchers, **doctors, and **clients* can come together to co-create and fund research.  
It aims to democratize access to research collaboration, where anyone â€” whether an independent researcher or a funding entity â€” can participate in the scientific advancement process without the reliance on centralized institutions. The platform allows secure, transparent, and trackable progress, thanks to blockchain and decentralized storage solutions.

## ðŸ§  Team & Approach

### Team Name:  
MegaByte Team

### Team Members:  
- *Aditya Gunjkar*  - Frontend and Blockchain Developer 
- *Lakshya Agarwal* - Frontend and Integration Expert 

### Your Approach:  
- We chose to solve the problem of *inefficient collaboration* and *limited funding* in scientific research. By integrating *blockchain* and *decentralized storage*, we created a platform that empowers researchers, doctors, and clients to work together seamlessly.
- We overcame several challenges, such as *version control for research papers* and ensuring *security* with decentralized file storage (IPFS). 
- A breakthrough was implementing a *role-based access system* for seamless collaboration and fine-grained control over who could edit or approve research papers.
